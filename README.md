# static-analysis

(Work in progress!) implementation of abstract interpretation over a simple assembly style language.

Supports modular choice of lattice and currently implements a sign lattice, with plans for interval lattice and more fancy stuff.

General idea is to compile other languages into this and perform analysis to detect security-related vulnerabilities.
